# Disclaimers for Fundraiser Participants

* The Essential Cosmos Software and Services may not complete in the advertised
  timeline due to unforeseen issues and circumstances.

* The Cosmos Hub may not gain significant market adoption due to a failure for
  the atom holders to coorinate effectively, or due to competition.

* The first 6 hours of the Fundraiser is uncapped, so there may be significant
  dillution relative to the total number of atoms at Genesis.

* There may be unintended bugs in software and theory that cause the project to
  fail for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, bugs in
Tendermint Core, bugs in the Cosmos Hub ABCI application, bugs in client or
wallet software, etc.

* There may be irreconciliable differences among atom holders that cause the
  Cosmos Hub blockchain to split (hard-fork) into two or more blockchains.  This
may cause economic harm for end-users and related services such as
crypto-exchanges .

* A majority or supermajority of the atom holders may pass proposals that go
  against the interest of the remaining atom holders.

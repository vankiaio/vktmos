## A couple of paragraphs about your company

We're a small startup creating an ambitious project, to upgrade the
Bitcoin/blockchain/cryptocurrency/altcoins ecosystem with exciting new
technology.

We started in 2014 with Tendermint (see tendermint.com).  Tendermint is an
open-source, and free blockchain consensus engine.  Instead of using
proof-of-work mining as in Bitcoin to secure the ledger, we use public-private
key cryptography and "classical" BFT algorithms.  Tendermint is much faster,
much more energy efficient, and potentially more secure.  In addition, it lets
us scale blockchains horizontally without compromising on security.

This website is about Cosmos, which uses Tendermint technology.

Cosmos is a network of independent parallel blockchains that are each powered by
classical BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint
[1](http://github.com/tendermint/tendermint).  The first blockchain in this
network will be the Cosmos Hub.  The Cosomos Hub connects to many other
blockchains (or _zones_) via a novel inter-blockchain communication protocol.
The Cosmos Hub tracks numerous token types, and keeps record of the total
number of tokens in each connected zone.  Tokens can be transferred from one
zone to another, securely and quickly, without the need for a liquid exchange
between zones, because all inter-zone coin transfers go through the Cosmos Hub.

This architecture solves so many problems that the blockchain space faces today,
including application interoperability, scalability, and seamless upgradability.
For example, zones derived from Bitcoind, Go-Ethereum, CryptoNote, ZCash, or any
blockchain system can be plugged into the Cosmos Hub.  These zones allow Cosmos
to scale infinitely to meet global transaction demand.  And, zones are a great
fit for a distributed exchange, which will be supported as well.

Cosmos is not just a single distributed ledger, and the Cosmos Hub isn't a
walled garden or the center of its universe.  We are designing a protocol for an
open network of distributed legers that can serve as a new foundation for our
future financial systems, based on principles of cryptography, sound economics,
consensus theory, transparency, and accountability.

## The products your sell or services you provide

We are crowdfunding for a public blockchain.  We create free and open software
and design distributed protocols.  The service that Cosmos provides is the
accounting of virtual tokens/coins.

## The size of the company – e.g. the number of employees, a rough turnover figure

3 employees and a budding community

## Are you an international company? If so, which countries?

The founders are from the US and Canada, but our supporters are global.

## How long have you been established?

The Tendermint project started in 2014.  The Cosmos project is brand spanking
new.

## Describe the company using five or ten words

Ambitious, computer-science, crypto-economic, game-theoretic, ambitious,
inevitable, internet-of-money, ambitious

## Outline the aims of the website

* raise awareness of Cosmos - overview of what it's about to pique interest
* announce our Crowdsale coming up in early October, with countdown timer & date
* stay minimal

## Who is the target audience?

Bitcoiners, cryptocurrency folk, financiers, open-source programmers, Bitcoin
miners, libertarians, crypto-anarchists, trans-humanists, crypto speculators,
computer-scientists, activists

## How will your target audience be accessing your site – via their phones, tablets or desktops?

Phones, Laptops

## Is the new website part of a re-brand, or a new product launch?

Yes, this is a new product launch

## Is there other advertising taking place that the new website should tie in with?

Yes, there will be a Reddit community, Bitcointalk community, Slack community,
and a Twitter account.  We also want to collect emails for a newsletter

## What are the unique selling points for your company, your products or your services?

We have a good reputation for having created good technology with solid theory.

## Is the market already saturated with competitors?

Maybe.  Lisk, Rootstock, Ethereum, Blockstream ... though none strictly compete
with us for the Cosmos vision.  Another aspect of Cosmos is that like the
internet, it's about interconnectness and cooperation under a common protocol,
so in the future our competition will tie into our network as well.

## List a few competitors’ websites.

Again, these aren't actually competitors, but they're in our space.

## Budget

$1500 for exploring sketch/mockup/wireframe, more to implement, more for copy.
Total budget is ~ $10K
